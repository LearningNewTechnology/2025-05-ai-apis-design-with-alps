# ðŸ§  Prompt Template for ALPS Generation from API Story

Use this template when prompting an LLM to convert an API Story into a valid ALPS profile.

---

## ðŸ”¶ Prompt Format

```text
Please create an ALPS profile based on the following API Story. This profile should represent a complete and consistent application state design.

* Format: JSON
* Language: English
* Input: API Story describing application purpose, data properties, resources, and actions
* Requirements:
  - All descriptors must have unique IDs
  - Ontology fields must use `type: semantic` and `lowerCamelCase` IDs
  - Resource states must use `UpperCamelCase` IDs and `type: semantic`
  - Operations (choreography) must use `type: safe`, `unsafe`, or `idempotent`
  - Actions should use `go` or `do` prefixes based on type
  - Each operation must specify `rt` (return state) and include input fields via `href`
  - **Required inputs must be annotated in the `doc.value` of the operation descriptor**
  - Tags must be applied consistently for grouping
  - The document must include all necessary fields, states, and transitions
  - The final ALPS must pass a structural verification

API Story:
# Task Management


## Purpose
We need to track 'Task' records in order to improve both timeliness and accuracy of customer follow-up activity.


## Data Properties
In this first pass at the application, we need to keep track of the following data properties: 

 * **id** : a globally unique value for each record [uuid]
 * **title** : the text content of the record (the title of the task) [string]
 * **description** : the description of the record (the task details) [text]
 * **dueDate** : the date the record is due to be completed [date]
 * **status** : Indicates the status of the record (active, completed) [enumerated string]
 * **priority** : the priority of the task (a number between 1 and 5) [enumerated number]
 * **assignedUser** : the user assigned to handle the task (a simple name string) [string]


## Resources
The following are resources, or states, of the API. Each state has one or more possible Actions.

 * **Home** : The home or landing page of the API. Users typically start here.
   * Actions: **GetTaskList**
 * **TaskCollection** : The list of tasks in the system are displayed here.
   * Actions: **Home**, **GetFilteredTaskList**, **CreateNewTask**,**GetTaskItem**
 * **TaskItem** : This resource shows a single task (selected from the TaskCollection)
   * Actions: **EditExistingTask**, **UpdateStatusOfTask**, **SetDueDateOfTask**, **AssignUserToTask**, **GetTaskList**, **GetFilteredTaskList**, **Home**
 
## Actions
This edition of the application needs to support the following operations. Each action has zero or more input properties and always has one return value (to another state). Each action is also marked as either Safe (GET), Unsafe (POST), Idempotent (PUT/PATCH), or Delete (DELETE)

 * **ShowHomePage** : Use this action to display the `home` resource
   * Inputs: None
   * Returns: **Home**
   * Type: Safe
 * **GetTaskCollection** : Use this action to return a list of all Task records in the system
   * Inputs: None
   * Returns: **TaskCollection**
   * Type: Safe
 * **GetTaskItem**: Use this action to get a single existing task record.  
   * Inputs: id
   * Required: id
   * Returns: **TaskItem**
   * Type: Safe
 * **CreateNewTask** : Use this action to add a new Task record to the system
   * Inputs: id, title, description, dueDate, status, priority, assignedUser
   * Required: id, title, status
   * Returns: **TaskCollection**
   * Type: Unsafe
 * **EditExistingTask** : Use this action to modify an existing Task record to the system
   * Inputs: id, title, description, dueDate, status, priority, assignedUser
   * Required: id, title, status
   * Returns: **TaskItem**
   * Type: Unsafe
 * **UpdateStatusOfTask** : Use this action to update the `status` of a single record
   * Inputs: id, status
   * Required: id, status
   * Returns: **TaskItem**
   * Type: Idempotent
 * **SetDueDateOfTask** : Use this action to set the `dueDate` of a single record
   * Inputs: id, dueDate
   * Required: id, dueDate
   * Returns: **TaskItem**
   * Type: Idempotent
 * **AssignUserToTask** : Use this action to update the name of the `assignedUser` of a single record
   * Inputs: id, assignedUser
   * Required: id, assignedUser
   * Returns: **TaskItem**
   * type: Idempotent
 * **GetFilteredTaskCollection** : Use this action to filter the list of tasks by `title`, `dueDate`, `status`, `priority`  and/or `assignedUser`
   * Inputs: title, dueDate,status, priority
   * Returns: **TaskCollection**
   * Type: Safe

## Rules
 * When executing **CreateNewTask**, the client should supply a unique `id` value.

â€”orâ€”
Attach the API Story as a file and instruct the LLM to read from the file content.

## ðŸ”¹ Example Invocation

```text
Please create an ALPS profile from the attached file describing a Task Management system. Be sure to include all fields and actions, and annotate required fields for each operation in the ALPS `doc.value` block.
```

## âœ… Output Format

- JSON ALPS document
- Includes `$schema` and `alps.version`
- Fully structured: ontology, taxonomy, choreography
- Required fields listed in transition `doc.value` (e.g., "Required: id, status")
- No comments in JSON
