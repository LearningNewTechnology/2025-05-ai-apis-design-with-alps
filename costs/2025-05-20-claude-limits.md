The main token differences between Anthropic's Free and Pro plans are:

**Free Plan** (8k?)
- Limited to a certain number of messages per day
- Shorter message length and context window 
- No access to Claude 3.7 Sonnet's extended thinking/reasoning mode

**Pro Plan** (200k token limit)
- Significantly higher message limits
- Longer message length and context window
- Access to Claude 3.7 Sonnet's extended thinking/reasoning mode for improved reasoning quality

For the most current and specific information about token limits, pricing, and other plan differences, I'd recommend checking Anthropic's support page at https://support.anthropic.com as these details may have been updated since my knowledge cutoff.

Is there anything specific about the plans you're interested in understanding better?
