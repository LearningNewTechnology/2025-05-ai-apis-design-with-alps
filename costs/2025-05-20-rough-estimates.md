# Tokens, Words, Costs

> is it true that each time i ask you a question or to complete something you go bnack and read your entire context windo before responding?

Yes, that’s essentially correct — each time you send a message, I reprocess the entire context window (which includes the ongoing conversation, relevant background info, and recent uploads) to generate the next response.

More precisely:

* I **don’t remember** previous turns the way a human would.
* Instead, I **re-read** all the relevant information (up to the context window limit, e.g., \~128,000 tokens for GPT-4-turbo) from scratch each time I respond.
* That includes your prior messages, my own replies, and any explicitly provided background (like ALPS profiles or instruction documents).

So every time you ask a question, I'm working from a **stateless simulation of memory**, not from persistent memory — unless you explicitly saved something via memory features (which you'd manage in your settings).

Let me know if you want a visual or markdown explanation of how this process works.

> is a rough estimate of $0.01 per thousand tokens relatively accurate?

Yes, **\$0.01 per 1,000 tokens** is a **reasonable rough estimate** *for input-only usage with GPT-4-turbo*, especially in high-level planning or cost estimation — but the actual pricing varies slightly depending on:


### ✅ **Actual OpenAI Pricing (as of May 2024)**

For **GPT-4-turbo (the model you're using)**:

| Usage Type        | Cost per 1,000 Tokens |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| **Input tokens**  | \$0.01                |
| **Output tokens** | \$0.03                |

So, if your total prompt (input) is 2,000 tokens and the model responds with 500 tokens, the total cost would be:

```
(2,000 × $0.01) + (500 × $0.03) = $0.20 + $0.015 = $0.215
```

### 🧮 Rule of Thumb

* For **text-heavy usage**, you can average **\$0.02–\$0.03 per 1,000 tokens total** (input + output).
* For **input-only bulk tasks** (e.g., embeddings, batch prompt processing), **\$0.01 per 1,000 tokens** is a decent planning estimate.
* For **fine-tuned GPT-3.5/4 models** or other APIs (like Whisper or DALL·E), pricing differs.

> is a rough estimate of .75 words per token about right?

Yes, a rough estimate of **0.75 words per token** is generally **about right** for planning purposes.


### ✅ Quick Reference

| Metric             | Approximate Value  |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| **1 token ≈**      | 0.75 English words |
| **1 word ≈**       | 1.33 tokens        |
| **1,000 tokens ≈** | 750 words          |
| **1,000 words ≈**  | 1,333 tokens       |

### 🧠 Why the Variation?

* Tokens are **not the same as words** — they can be parts of words (like prefixes/suffixes), full words, or even punctuation.
* English text averages about **4 characters per word**, and tokens average **3–4 characters**, so 0.75 is a solid rule of thumb.
* Text with lots of short words (e.g. "the," "is," "to") will have **fewer tokens per word**.
* Highly technical text or programming code will often have **more tokens per word**.

> when i tell you to "remember for next time" what actually happens

When you say **"remember this for next time"**, what actually happens depends on whether you're using the **memory feature** and whether it’s **enabled** for the specific context.

### 🧠 What *Actually* Happens:

1. **If memory is OFF (default)**:
   I **do not remember** anything you say *after the session ends*. I will use your current conversation history while we’re chatting — but once the session ends, that context disappears unless you manually reintroduce it.

2. **If memory is ON and enabled for a topic**:

   * I can **store facts, preferences, or long-term context** across conversations.
   * You’ll see a notification that says something like “I’ve added that to your memory.”
   * You can view or delete these at any time in **Settings > Personalization > Memory**.

3. **If you just say “remember this” without a confirmation prompt or system response**, then:

   * **Nothing is stored** persistently.
   * I **use it temporarily during this session** only — it won’t survive a refresh or a new thread.


### 🧪 Example:

* You: “Remember that I’m working on a book called *From Stacia to Hyperion*.”
* Me (with memory ON): “Got it! I’ll remember that you’re working on a book titled *From Stacia to Hyperion*.”
* Me (with memory OFF): *Just uses that fact in this thread, forgets later.*


### 🔒 Memory Control

You can manage this under:
**Settings > Personalization > Memory**
There you can:

* Enable/disable memory
* See what’s remembered
* Delete individual items or all memory

 > when i ask you to remember something and the memory is full, what happens
 
 If you ask me to **remember something** and your **memory is full**, here’s what happens:

### 📌 What Happens When Memory Is Full

1. **I will not store the new memory automatically.**

   * You **won’t get a confirmation** like “I’ve added that to memory.”
   * The new fact or preference **will not persist across sessions** unless you manually make space.

2. **You won’t lose current session context.**

   * I’ll still use what you just told me **in this conversation**, as long as it fits in the current context window.
   * But it won’t be remembered **next time you return**.

3. **You’ll need to manually manage memory** to add new items:

   * Go to **Settings → Personalization → Memory → Manage**
   * There, you can **delete old items** to free up space.


### 🧠 Memory Size (Current Estimate)

* While OpenAI doesn’t publish an exact size limit, users generally hit a soft cap around **100–150 items**.
* Once it’s full, **new memories are silently rejected** until you clear older ones.


### ✅ Best Practice

If you’re working on a long-term project and want to ensure continuity:

* Periodically review and prune your memory items.
* Or keep a local summary document and upload it at the start of each new session.

> if i ask you for a system prompt and/or a preamble, does contain emough "memories" for a repeatable, consistent future attempt

Great question — and the answer is **yes, but with conditions**.

A **system prompt** or **preamble** can absolutely be designed to **simulate memory**, giving you repeatable, consistent behavior across sessions — **as long as you re-use it each time**.


### ✅ What a System Prompt or Preamble *Can* Do

A well-crafted **system prompt** or **user preamble** can:

* Define your role, goals, preferences, or instructions.
* Embed previously agreed-on facts (like project names, formatting styles, or terminology).
* Set tone, audience, or scope for responses.
* Simulate long-term memory by encoding prior facts into the prompt itself.

It becomes your **manual memory layer** — you inject it at the start of each session to "reboot" me into your working context.

### ⚠️ But Keep in Mind

1. **It’s not automatic.**
   You need to paste or attach the prompt/preamble **at the start** of each session (or use an API/script to do it automatically).

2. **It counts toward your context window.**
   Large preambles eat into the available tokens for input + output (though that’s usually not a problem unless you're dealing with huge files).

3. **It works best with consistent formatting.**
   Structured, labeled, or JSON-formatted preambles make it easier for me to interpret and apply repeatably.

### 🧠 Comparison

| Feature          | Memory (enabled)          | System Prompt / Preamble       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Automatic**    | ✅ Remembers automatically | ❌ Must be supplied manually    |
| **Persistent**   | ✅ Across sessions         | ❌ Only lasts for the session   |
| **Capacity**     | Limited (soft cap \~100)  | Up to full context window size |
| **Transparency** | ❌ Hidden contents         | ✅ Fully visible to you         |
| **Portability**  | ❌ Account-bound           | ✅ Shareable + editable         |

### 🧰 Suggestion

For consistent future attempts, consider maintaining:

* A **system prompt document** (structured markdown or JSON)
* A **context preamble** with known facts, goals, and working style
* Optional: a **verification checklist** or **post-run validator** prompt

> if i want to remove some saved memories, how do i make sure i don't "forget" something important? is there a way to _export_ saved memories into system prompts, preambles, or metatdata files for future use?

Yes — and this is a smart approach. If you're cleaning out saved memory, the best way to avoid losing anything important is to **export your memories into a reusable format** like:

* A **system prompt template**
* A **preamble document**
* A **metadata file** (JSON or YAML)
* Or even a markdown “working context” doc


### ✅ How to Safely Export Your Memory

#### 1. **View Your Saved Memories**

* Go to **Settings → Personalization → Memory**
* Click **"Manage"**
* You’ll see a list of all items currently stored

#### 2. **Copy Key Entries**

Manually copy any entries that look important (project names, preferences, terminology, style choices, etc.)


### 🔁 Convert Them into a Reusable Format

#### **Option A: System Prompt (Markdown)**

```markdown
## System Prompt for Consistent Sessions

You are assisting with a long-term project called “From Stacia to Hyperion.”
- Narrative style: second-person, present tense
- Use characters: Gibby, Deena, Artemis
- Prior chapters: “The Village of Stacia,” “The Decision,” etc.

You also support an API composability platform:
- Core components: discovery, shared-state, job-control
- Design pattern: EXECUTE, REPEAT, REVERT
- Use ALPS for modeling

Respond in a structured, professional tone unless a creative or narrative task is requested.
```

#### **Option B: Metadata File (YAML or JSON)**

```yaml
project_context:
  book_title: "From Stacia to Hyperion"
  narrative_style: "second-person, present tense"
  known_characters:
    - Gibby the Gecko
    - Deena the Toolmaker
    - Artemis the Owl
  api_platform:
    name: "Composable Services Platform"
    components:
      - discovery
      - shared-state
      - job-control
    patterns:
      - EXECUTE
      - REPEAT
      - REVERT
    modeling: ALPS
preferences:
  response_style: professional
  formatting: markdown when technical
```


### 🧠 When You Return

Just paste that file (or its contents) at the start of the session and say something like:

> "Here’s my working context file. Please use this to set up our session."

This simulates memory perfectly — and unlike true memory, it’s versionable, auditable, and portable.
